This README will contain explanations to each day and how to solve each day using LISP.
I solve each solution first using Python, because it is the programming language with
the most amount of libraries and the easiest to do a lot of things without thinking
or searching them up. LISP is really good for explaining how something works though
because it is a self-documenting and verbose language that is easy to read.

Most of the reason why I have this is because of the secret algorithm club and their dang
algorithms that I had no idea about that I would like to come back later and see my own
notes on them instead of just blatently copying someone else's code.

I will try to make my LISP code as easy to understand as possible but there are no
guarantees.

The format of LISP I will be using, so that it is easy for others to setup and execute
easily, will be Emacs LISP.
